<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m an aspiring full-stack developer and future SaaS entrepreneur, passionate
  about building web applications that solve real-world problems. My journey
  started with Python, where I developed strong skills in automation, databases,
  and backend development using Django. Over time, I expanded into full-stack
  web development, working on projects like a CRM system, a task manager app,
  and a Discord bot. Now, I’m diving deeper into front-end technologies (HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript) to enhance my ability to create seamless and
  user-friendly web applications. My goal is to build and monetize SaaS
  applications while continuously improving my expertise in full-stack
  development.

<p>
  Beyond just coding, I enjoy tackling real-world challenges through
  problem-solving and efficient software design. I follow a hands-on learning
  approach, working on structured courses and personal projects to refine my
  skills. I have experience working with databases like PostgreSQL and TinyDB,
  API integrations, and deployment strategies for making applications
  production-ready. I also take an interest in automation and scripting, using
  Python to create useful tools that enhance productivity.

<p>
  Looking ahead, I’m focused on mastering Django and expanding my front-end
  expertise to create fully interactive, scalable applications. My long-term
  goal is to develop and launch SaaS products that provide value to businesses
  and individuals. I am also exploring freelancing opportunities and plan to
  leverage my knowledge to build innovative and efficient web solutions. Whether
  it's optimizing a backend system, crafting a smooth UI, or automating tasks,
  I’m always eager to learn, adapt, and create impactful technology.

  In case you're wondering if it's true or not, most of it is, but it's mostly
  used as dummy data. I don't have exp with PostgreSQL yet, or deployment
  strategies for example haha... oops
